I'm an active-duty U.S. Army soldier with a passion for IT, networking, and cybersecurity. My journey blends hands-on military experience with academic knowledge in IT and business, as well as personal study in cybersecurity. 

Whether it's configuring networks or tackling security challenges, I thrive on solving complex problems and continually growing my expertise.

## Objective
